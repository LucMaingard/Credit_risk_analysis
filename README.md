# Credit Risk Analysis
Using a random forest regressor to analyse and predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan.

## Description
This projects serves to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan. This will help banks know exactly the level of risk associated with a 
particular loan and thus allow for better and more informed decisions to be made. The model takes in 20 parameters about 1000 previous customers to find 
indicators of high risk individuals based on previously defaulted loans.
